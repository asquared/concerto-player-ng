This is a modified copy of scripts included with the 'archiso' distrobution.
That distribution is available at http://projects.archlinux.org/archiso.git.

Some files in that distribution include GPLv2 notices. Therefore, I have
assumed that the entire distribution is available under GPLv2.

So, here goes...

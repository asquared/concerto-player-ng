Notes on building...

Make sure the KERNEL_VERSION in the Makefile is set properly. If you see lots
of warnings about '/lib/modules/2.6.xx-ARCH' or 'sr_mod.ko' not being found,
this is the likely problem. The KERNEL_VERSION needs to be set to the version
in use in the live system; if the build doesn't work, get the version from
`ls work/root-image/lib/modules`.

A copy of isolinux.bin needs to be put into boot-files/syslinux. This can be
gotten from /usr/lib/syslinux if the syslinux package is installed on Arch.
If you're using this on another distro, you're on your own.

And the license information...

This is a modified copy of scripts included with the 'archiso' distrobution.
That distribution is available at http://projects.archlinux.org/archiso.git.

Some files in that distribution include GPLv2 notices. Therefore, I have
assumed that the entire distribution is available under GPLv2.
